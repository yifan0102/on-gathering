        <p style="width: 400px;">*Gathering Robert Adams*<br>These photoes are from Robert Adams's “What We Bought:The New World”,a body of work that had been completed by the American photographer twenty-five years before.The photo as a whole is considered as a signature work that Adams ever produced. (In April 2000, the Yale University Art Gallery purchased the 193 prints that compose Robert Adams's What We Bought:The New World)
            These photos were printed in a unique edition, remain intact for more than two decades before becoming available for acquisition, and being exhibited.An interesting fact is that this collection of about three hundred prints were from the unselected photos of Adams‘ Guggenheim project denver.
            What we bought echoed Adams' 1977 book, Denver:A Photographic Survey of the Metropolitan Area, and the subtitle -- The New World invoked The New West documenting the overdevelopment of the land around Denver in the early 1970s. Through these pictures we can see the depredations of urban sprawl; specifically, the flourishing forms of it he found metastasizing along the length of Colorado's interstate highways and through the suburban developments that followed those roads beyond Colorado Springs and into the Front Range of the Rockies.
            Frustrated by the apparent destruction and overexploitation of the landscape, Adams took these pictures with precision. In 1995, he wrote about these pictures: “ These pictures record what we purchased, what we paid, and what we could not buy.”
            Denver has historically been a frontier town in the United States, founded by gold seekers in 1861. Its economy is based on gambling, taverns, livestock and commodity trading services for local miners. In the early days, land parcels were often traded for grubstakes or gambled away by miners in Auraria. Denver's gold rush and the rapid development of the railroad led to an influx of not only elites and a large middle class, but also a growing population of German immigrants, Italian immigrants, and Chinese laborers, as well as African-Americans and Spanish from the Deep South workers. The influx of new residents strained housing supply. In addition, the Silver Crash of 1893 also unsettled political, social and economic balance.
            Denver's history can be summed up simply as a cycle of booms and depressions. Among the most startling periods of growth occurred in the 1960s and 70s, when Colorado’s oil, military, and tourism industries were booming.
            As the population of the Denver metropolitan area increased and housing supply tightened, large tracts of hastily conceived commercial and residential buildings were added, thus weakening the social fabric that once had relatively well-defined borders.
            Adams aims to document what Americans buy, pay for, and can't buy."They document the separation from ourselves and, in turn, from the natural world we profess to love." Adams said.For more than three decades, his photographs have focused on depicting the relationship between human activity and the land, revealing the devastating and relentless impact of economic and real estate, tourism development on the land. From these photos, we can see bleak and forlorn.Demonstrate manifestations of unchecked growth brought about by human: tract housing, strip malls, storage building, construction sites, and scarred lands.
            I borrowed this book from the university library, and from the page by page of black and white photos, I felt the silence, solitude, emptiness and depression that the world convey to me. Reminds me of a reviewer who said:
            Adams’ roads serve as thoughtful metaphors for solitude, connection or freedom. No artist has a visual language for speaking about landscape, the politics of development, urbanization, and the eradication of the natural environment quite like that of Robert Adams.
